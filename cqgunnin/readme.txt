cqgunnin was an unfinished project of mine. I have it backed up privately, but I want the music to be fully accessible from anywhere.
it was a strategy game basically, where you Gunned in Close Quarters with your little group of pixel guys with pixel guns.
one of these days I do want to give it a release. not today.
